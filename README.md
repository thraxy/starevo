# Star Evolution Simulator

This is a C++ project for simulating the evolution of stars in astrophysics.

## Directory Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains external data files or resources used by the simulator.
- `output/`: Stores output files generated by the simulator, such as simulation results, logs, or visualizations.
- `src/`: Contains the source code for the simulator.
    - `calculations/`: Holds modules or functions responsible for performing calculations related to stellar evolution.
    - `includes/`: Contains header files (.h or .hpp) that declare classes, structs, or function prototypes.
    - `main/`: Contains the entry point of the program, typically the `main.cpp` file.
    - `models/`: Stores the classes or structures representing different models in the simulator.
    - `tests/`: Holds unit tests or integration tests for validating the implementation.
    - `utils/`: Contains general-purpose functions or helper modules.
